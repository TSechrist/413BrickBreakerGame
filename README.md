# csc413 - Brick Breaker Game

## Student Name : Thomas Sechrist

### This is a brickbreaker clone that I have made by modifying my tank game code. This was a good project to learn how to reuse previous code to create a new project.

### Left and right arrow keys control the paddle. Space bar will start the ball moving.
